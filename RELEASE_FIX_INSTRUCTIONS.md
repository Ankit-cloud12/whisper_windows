# WhisperApp Release Issue Fix

## Problem Identified

The GitHub release for v1.0.0 has no executable installer because there was no GitHub Actions workflow configured to automatically build and upload release artifacts when tags are pushed.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created GitHub Actions Release Workflow

**File**: `.github/workflows/release.yml`

This workflow will:
- Trigger automatically on tag pushes (v*)
- Build WhisperApp using CMake and Qt6
- Deploy Qt dependencies with windeployqt
- Create NSIS installer package
- Create portable ZIP package
- Generate SHA256 checksums
- Create GitHub release with all artifacts

### 2. Updated NSIS Installer Configuration

**File**: `installer/installer.nsi`

Updated the installer script to:
- Use correct build output paths (`build/dist/` instead of `build/release/`)
- Handle missing optional files gracefully with `/nonfatal` flag
- Use the correct Visual C++ Redistributable path

### 3. Created Manual Trigger Script

**File**: `scripts/trigger-release-workflow.bat`

Batch script to manually trigger the release workflow for existing tags.

## Next Steps to Fix the v1.0.0 Release

### Option 1: Commit Changes and Re-trigger Workflow (Recommended)

1. **Commit the new workflow files:**
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/release.yml
   git add installer/installer.nsi
   git add scripts/trigger-release-workflow.bat
   git add RELEASE_FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md
   git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions release workflow and fix installer configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Manually trigger the workflow for v1.0.0:**
   ```bash
   # Using GitHub CLI (if installed)
   gh workflow run release.yml --field tag=v1.0.0
   
   # OR via GitHub web interface:
   # Go to: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/whisper_windows/actions/workflows/release.yml
   # Click "Run workflow"
   # Enter "v1.0.0" in the tag field
   # Click "Run workflow"
   ```

### Option 2: Re-create the v1.0.0 Tag

If manual triggering doesn't work, you can re-create the tag to trigger the workflow automatically:

```bash
# Delete the existing tag locally and remotely
git tag -d v1.0.0
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.0

# Recreate and push the tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## Expected Results

After the workflow runs successfully, the v1.0.0 release will have:

1. **WhisperApp-1.0.0-Setup.exe** - Full installer with dependencies
2. **WhisperApp-1.0.0-portable-win64.zip** - Portable version
3. **SHA256 checksum files** for verification
4. **Detailed release notes** with installation instructions

## Workflow Features

### Automatic Builds
- Builds on `windows-latest` runner
- Uses Visual Studio 2022 with MSVC
- Installs Qt 6.6.3 automatically
- Installs NSIS for installer creation

### Dependencies Handled
- Qt6 Core, Widgets, Multimedia, Network
- Visual C++ Redistributable
- All required Windows libraries

### Artifact Management
- Creates both installer and portable packages
- Generates SHA256 checksums for verification
- Uploads artifacts to GitHub release
- Retains build artifacts for 30 days

### Release Notes
- Auto-generated with download links
- Installation instructions
- System requirements
- Verification instructions

## Monitoring the Workflow

1. **View workflow runs:**
   - Go to: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/whisper_windows/actions`
   - Click on the "Release WhisperApp" workflow

2. **Check build logs:**
   - Click on any workflow run
   - Expand each step to see detailed logs

3. **Download artifacts:**
   - Build artifacts are available even if release creation fails
   - Check the "Artifacts" section at the bottom of the workflow run page

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Qt Installation Fails:**
- The workflow uses Qt 6.6.3 which should be compatible
- If needed, update the Qt version in the workflow

**NSIS Not Found:**
- The workflow downloads and installs NSIS automatically
- Check the "Install NSIS" step logs

**Build Failures:**
- Check CMake configuration step
- Verify all source files are present
- Check whisper.cpp submodule status

**Installer Creation Fails:**
- Check NSIS script syntax
- Verify all referenced files exist in build/dist/
- Check installer build step logs

### Manual Build for Testing

You can test the build process locally before committing:

```bash
# Run the existing build script
cd scripts
./prepare-release.bat
```

## Security Considerations

- The workflow uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` with default permissions
- No sensitive information is exposed in logs
- All downloads are from official sources (Qt, NSIS, VC Redist)

## Future Improvements

1. **Code Signing**: Add certificate-based code signing for the installer
2. **Model Bundling**: Optionally include pre-downloaded Whisper models
3. **Multi-Architecture**: Add ARM64 support for newer Windows systems
4. **Automated Testing**: Add installer testing on clean VMs
5. **Release Drafts**: Create draft releases for manual review before publishing

This fix ensures that future tag pushes will automatically create properly built releases with installers, solving the original issue where v1.0.0 had no executable artifacts.
